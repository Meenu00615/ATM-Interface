# ATM-Interface
ATM Interface in Java  The ATM interface is a Java application designed to provide a user-friendly and efficient experience for managing banking transactions. It incorporates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to organize the code into modular and reusable components.

1. User Authentication:
Users can securely log in using their unique credentials.
Object-oriented design ensures encapsulation and protection of sensitive user information.

2. Transaction Management:
Supports various transactions like balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and fund transfers.
Utilizes OOP principles such as encapsulation to keep transaction details private.

3. Heap Sort for Transaction History:
Implements heap sort to efficiently organize and display transaction history.
Ensures quick retrieval and display of recent transactions.

4. Account Management:
Users can manage their account details, including updating personal information and changing PINs.
Encapsulation and inheritance are employed to create a robust account management system.

5. GUI (Graphical User Interface):
Employs Java's Swing or JavaFX for a user-friendly graphical interface.
Adheres to design principles for a clean and intuitive layout.

6. Concurrency and Security:
Utilizes OOP concepts such as multithreading for concurrent processing of transactions.
Implements security measures to protect against unauthorized access and transactions.

7. Code Organization:
Classes like User, Account, and Transaction follow OOP principles.
The HeapSort class handles sorting of transaction history using the heap sort algorithm.

8. Conclusion:
The ATM interface in Java showcases the power of object-oriented design, ensuring modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The integration of heap sort enhances the efficiency of managing transaction history, providing users with a seamless and secure banking experience.
